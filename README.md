# First DJI TELLO FLIGHT

Nov/2/2025
This is the first flight with the dji tello. There are a few things to note, the firt obvious one is that there is limited amount of code available now since that the TELLO got discountined years ago. So I have to go off of what I have here and the notes.

There are lots of things I plan to do with this drone, and a lot of projects that I want to try out. This folder is just the basic flight and getting this off the ground. Other than that let's get to it.
